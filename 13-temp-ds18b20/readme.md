# Description

This example demonstrates a state machine that handles IO with an external device.
The device drives LEDS to indicate a temperature range, blue <20'c, green >20'c <25'C, rood > 25'C.
When something fails the LED will shine white, when the LED stays off, check if pin 42 (reset) is grounded.

# Temp DS18B20

A fully fledged example on how to create a state machine that drives a generic module.
In this case a one-wire module is used to drive a DS18B20 temperature sensor.
Because of the states the transactions go through and the process as a whole goes through,
a state machine is used that works in multiple layers.

* read\_temp - Contains the high level state machine running through the commands
* ds18b20 - Drives the IC, sending the commands and waiting for the responses.
* sockit_owm - Encodes/decodes data over the one-wire protocol.

# Requirements

* Yosys
* Arachne-pnr
* Project IceStorm
* DS18B20
* 4.7kOhm Resistor
* Breadboard
* Some dupont wire

# Requirements

* Yosys
* Arachne-pnr
* Project IceStorm

# Usage

* ```make```

    Builds ```chip.bin``` bitstream

* ```make flash```

    Program the bitstream to the device.

* ```make sim```

    Checks the program via a simulation.

* ```make gtkwave```

    Opens a wave form viewer to show the simulated states the machine progresses to over time.

Expected output during flashing:

```
$ make flash
