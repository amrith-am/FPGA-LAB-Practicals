# Case statement

This example shows the use of case statements.

The case statement in Verilog is very important for creating state machines.
State machines are the basis of most digital synchronous systems.

## Requirements

* Yosys
* Arachne-pnr
* Project IceStorm

## Usage

* ```make```

    Builds ```chip.bin``` bitstream

* ```make flash```

    Program the bitstream to the device.
